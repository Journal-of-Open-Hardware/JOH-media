The international peer-reviewed Journal of Open Hardware publishes papers and reviews on technical, legal, economic, and sociocultural aspects of open hardware design, fabrication, and distribution.

OH is organized around the same principles guiding Free and Open Source development and Open Access publishing. We prioritize the exchange of knowledge by creating the conditions for the study, modification, redistribution and use of hardware designs for any purpose. To foster our mission, we ensure our publications include Open research data, Free and Open Source software, and fully documented hardware which are accessible, searchable, interoperable, and reusable.

Why publishing in the JOH?
- full gold access journal
- world leading experts in open source hardware
- rapid and professional review process
- peer-review of standalone documentation
- ethical publishing policy

**What is it?** The *Journal of Open Hardware* is an academic forum for open hardware research and development. Its primary goal is to bridge experimental practices of design, fabrication, and dissemination of hardware with professional, academic, and non-academic communities. It serves as a venue for hardware designers to deposit and disseminate their work and for researchers to publish original empirical research on sociocultural, legal, technical, and economic aspects of open hardware projects. In addition to full-length articles and hardware metapapers, we also invite submissions of review articles of open hardware events and opinion pieces on topics of interest to the Free and Open Source community.

**Why is it important?** The existence of our journal is key in taking the global efforts towards open science and open hardware to the next level. It helps to disseminate today the research equipment that will tomorrow allow the next scientific discovery. It also sets best practice standards in terms of high quality hardware documentation and therefore is a reference for open hardware communities.

**Why is it so special?** The uniqueness of the *Journal of Open Hardware* is to combine:
* **a peer-review of the hardware documentation**. Articles presenting a piece of open hardware are peer-reviewed along with the documentation of the considered piece of hardware. 
* **an independent community approach**. The journal is a bottom-up initiative emerging from communities of researchers and pratitioners of open hardware. It is independent from any big player in the scientific publishing market. 
* **a transparent peer-review process**. By default, credits is given to reviewers in the article and discussions between reviewers and authors is  published sa supplementary material.
* **an international board of scientists and experts from practice**. Our editorial board gathers word leading experts in the field of open hardware from both academia, business and community practice. 

**What do we need?** We are proud of our roots and are committed to keep our independence. We are looking for sponsors in order to gain momentum without needing to make concessions on our values. We need partners to support our efforts to spread the word and to deliver high quality publications. We offer to our sponsors an extended visibility of their brand in the open hardware communities by adding their logo on our promotion material (e.g. website, flyers).
